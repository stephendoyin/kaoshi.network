                End-to-end Transaction References or 'UETR' in a payment
                transaction) in the messages or files they send (API data)
                Kaoshi may have no relationship with these individuals. Only
                Kaoshi customers know their clients and employees, and have a
                contractual relationship with them. Kaoshi product users
                determine the purposes for which the personal data of their
                clients and employees may be processed and the most suitable

                retrieve personal data and determine the purposes and means of
                the processing of such personal data.

              <h3>Sharing Data</h3>
              <h4>Storage and sharing of your data</h4>
              <p>
                The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
                stored at, a Kaoshi office / destination outside the United
                States. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
                United States who work for us or for one of our partners. Such
                staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the provision of
                support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to
                this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps
                reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
                securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. In these
                cases, we ensure that both ourselves and our partners take
                adequate and appropriate technical, physical and organisational
                security measures to protect your data. We also ensure we have
                appropriate contractual protections in place with these third
                parties. Before sharing your data, we require such third parties
                to only process your Personal Data upon our instructions and to
                provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and
                organizational security measures protecting the data processing
                activities. Such offices or third parties may be located in or
                outside the United States or European Economic Area (EEA),
                including in countries that do not offer a level of data
                protection considered as adequate under an EU Commission
                adequacy decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the latter case, we ensure the lawfulness of such transfers
                by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  agreeing with other Kaoshi offices on the approved standard
                  contractual clauses
                </li>
                <li>
                  agreeing with third parties on the most appropriate statutory,
                  contractual, or self-regulatory basis (for example, Privacy
                  Shield certification) to allow such transfers
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>

              <h4>Use for Statistical and Product Development Purposes</h4>
              <h4>Kaoshi as Data Controller</h4>
              <p>
                With regard to the processing of message data for statistical
                and product development purposes, Kaoshi acts as a data
                controller.
              </p>
              <p>Respective Roles</p>
              <p>
                a) Kaoshi relies on the following legal grounds to process
                personal data (that may be contained in message data) as a data
                controller:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Kaoshi needs to process the personal data to provide or
                  improve its services and products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kaoshi needs to process the personal data to comply with a
                  legal obligation, for example to respond to a legally
                  enforceable request from a competent authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kaoshi has a legitimate interest in processing the personal
                  data, for example when Kaoshi processes personal data for
                  statistical and product development purposes, and to otherwise
                  improve the safety, security, and performance of the Kaoshi
                  service offerings and products. Kaoshi only relies on its
                  legitimate interests to process personal data when these
                  interests are not overridden by the individual’s rights and
                  interests and when the processing is compatible with the
                  purposes for which the data was initially processed, as set
                  out in the applicable documentation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Kaoshi only shares personal data in such contexts with other
                Kaoshi affiliates, Kaoshi partner companies and third parties as
                described in the data transfer section.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a data controller, Kaoshi will comply with the following GDPR
                obligations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Personal data breach notification towards the Kaoshi product
                  users and competent data protection authorities, except as
                  otherwise provided by applicable law
                </li>
                <li>Maintaining internal records</li>
                <li>

                <li>
